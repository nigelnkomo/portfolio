# Personal Portfolio Website: Modern Design & UI Focus

This repository contains the latest iteration of my personal portfolio website, where I've focused deeply on modern design principles, user experience (UX), and code structure. This version represents a refined approach to showcasing my skills and personality in a professional context.

**Live Demo:** [https://nigelnkomo.github.io/portfolio/](https://nigelnkomo.github.io/portfolio/)

### Design Philosophy & Key Features:

* **Thoughtful Design Concepts:** Emphasized the strategic use of **negative space** and **positive space** to create a clean, uncluttered, and professional aesthetic.
* **Typography & Branding:** Carefully selected typography to enhance readability and convey a specific professional personality.
* **Clean & Minimalist Aesthetic:** Prioritized simplicity and clarity, allowing content to stand out effectively.
* **Dynamic Content Injection:** Utilized JavaScript and the `iframe` element to dynamically load page content, providing a smoother navigation experience without full page reloads.

### Technologies & Learning:

* **HTML5:** Structured the content with semantic HTML for accessibility and maintainability.
* **CSS3:** Employed advanced CSS techniques for layout, styling, and ensuring a visually cohesive and responsive design. The focus was on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable CSS.
* **JavaScript:** Implemented functionality for dynamic content loading, demonstrating basic DOM manipulation and event handling for an improved user flow.

### Development Process & Future Iterations:

This project was developed with a strong emphasis on continuous improvement and modularity. I leveraged **Git branching** for iterative development and exploring new design ideas, allowing for focused development on specific features or design changes.

I am currently working on a fourth iteration of this portfolio within a separate branch. This upcoming version will further refine the design by:
* Implementing more advanced CSS techniques to improve UI elements.
* Deepening the "why" behind design choices, moving beyond aesthetics to focus on usability and user psychology.
* Improving code architecture for even greater scalability and maintainability.
